# Studio

## Improvements over Studio 2

###Performance
* [LOD Mip Mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mipmap) to reduce graphics complexity
* Native canvas based
* Much smaller template size using [lz-string](http://pieroxy.net/blog/pages/lz-string/demo.html) (makes templates feasible again)

###Features
* Drag-and-drop file upload

###Concepts
* Built in a modular way to be easily expandable and adaptable
* Built with a clearer objective in mind
* No overhead from external libraries
